    <!-- Biography -->
    <section>
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is IDOWU OLATOMIWA STEPHEN, and I am the Lastborn in a family of
        four. Growing up in a lovly family has shaped my perspective on
        responsibility, hard work, and determination. My father, a retired
        doctor, has always been a beacon of strength and inspiration, showing me
        the value of perseverance and selflessness. On the other hand, my
        mother, who is a business woman, taught me resilience and the importance
        of staying hopeful even during challenging times. I am currently
        pursuing a degree in public adminsation at the odudu University ile ife
        osun state. This field has taught me the significance of precision,
        problem-solving, and adaptability, which are invaluable skills I aim to
        bring to the tech world. My passion for technology, particularly in
        frontend engineering, stems from a desire to create innovative solutions
        that address real-world problems and improve lives.

    <!-- Why I joined AltSchool section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool Africa Program</h2>
      <p>
        The ALT School of Engineering program represents an exciting opportunity
        to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
        application. Traditional academic institutions often focus heavily on
        theory, leaving little room for hands-on learning. ALT School, with its
        emphasis on functional and practical education, fills this gap
        effectively. My decision to join the program is also driven by my
        passion for learning cutting-edge technologies in a structured yet
        flexible environment. Through the program, I aim to refine my skills in
        frontend development, backend engineering, and cloud solutions.
        Moreover, the program aligns perfectly with my belief that technology
        should be used to create impactful solutions that make the world a
        better place.

    <!-- My Goals for the SOE program -->
    <section>
      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, my goal is to acquire relevant skills in software development,
        data science, or other technology-related fields that will enable me to
        contribute meaningfully to the industry. I see AltSchool Africa as the
        perfect launchpad to achieve this goal, equipping me with the knowledge
        and experience necessary to build innovative solutions and excel in my
        career.
